This repository contains the code for my research project on using a heterogeneous multi-agent system to achieve a more accurate and nuanced understanding of financial sentiment in text.

## üìñ Project Overview

Traditional sentiment analysis often fails with complex financial texts that contain speculation, sarcasm, or comparative language. This project tackles that problem by moving beyond a single AI model and instead creating a **"committee of expert agents,"** each with a unique specialization.

These agents analyze a piece of text from their own distinct perspective. A final "Synthesizer" agent then reviews their reports, weighs their confidence, and makes a final, reasoned judgment on the overall sentiment. This approach mimics a real-world financial analysis team and has shown promising results in classifying complex statements.

This project is the practical implementation of the framework proposed in my research paper, **"Structured Prompting and Heterogeneous LLM Multi-Agent Framework for Financial Sentiment Analysis,"** which was submitted to the IEEE COMPAS 2025 conference.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Agent System:** Utilizes a team of **seven specialized AI agents** built with **CrewAI**.
* **Diverse Expert Personas:** Includes agents specializing in linguistics, rhetoric, comparative logic, institutional investing, and retail trading to capture different layers of meaning.
* **High-Speed Inference:** Powered by **Groq** using the Llama 3.1 model for near-instantaneous analysis.
* **Structured Output:** The final agent produces a detailed JSON object with the sentiment, confidence score, and a clear justification for its decision.
* **Performance Evaluation:** The system's accuracy and F1-score are benchmarked against a ground-truth dataset using Scikit-learn.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The system processes each piece of financial text through a sequential pipeline of specialist agents. Each specialist produces a high-level analysis, which is then passed to a final agent for synthesis.
